👾 Pac-Man Game – x86 Assembly (MASM)
A retro-style Pac-Man game built using x86 Assembly Language and the Irvine32 library. This project was created as part of a low-level programming course to explore graphics, user input handling, and game logic using assembly.

How to Play
Use Arrow Keys to move Pac-Man in all 4 directions
Collect dots (·) to gain points
Avoid ghosts (@(RED),$(blue),%(pinky),&(clyde)) — collision costs a life
You have 3 lives total
The game ends when all lives are lost or all dots are eaten
or when you pres q for quit

🎮 Features
Smooth directional movement using arrow keys
Collectible dots and score tracking
Wall collision handling
Game-over conditions
Classic console-based gameplay visuals

🧠 Technologies Used
x86 Assembly (MASM)
Irvine32 Library

🛠️ How to Run
Install Visual Studio with MASM
Make sure Irvine32 library is set up properly
Open the .asm file in your IDE
Build and run the program

🧩 Challenges Faced
Managing continuous movement with limited key input handling
Handling screen redraws manually in the console
Implementing collision detection and movement logic without high-level structures

✨ What I Learned
Low-level memory operations and registers
Working with interrupts and keypress handling
Game logic structuring in assembly language

🙌 Credits
Built as part of coursework at FAST NUCES
Used Irvine32 library for I/O and display routines
